# ml_training
a repo for me and kaitlyn to practice writing clean ML code and dealing with practical problems (like GPU parallelization, training instability, etc)!

to do this, we are going through papers and implementing their code <3

paper list:
1. [DDPMS by Ho et. al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11239)
2. [Flash Attention by Dao et. al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135)
